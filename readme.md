Listen Vocaloid-themed radio on your favourate Windows 10 devices!

Unofficial UWP client for [VocaloidRadio](http://www.VocaloidRadio.com)


Words to say
==
So the following reasons make me build this unofficial client

- Poorly disigned [Official client](https://github.com/Deovandski/Vocaloid_Radio_Windows)
- Love for Vocaloid


Pros
- Much better design than [Official client](https://github.com/Deovandski/Vocaloid_Radio_Windows) 
- Live tile 
- Target for UWP platform

Cons
 - Dirty Code
 - Terrible naming
 - No comments

I'll  take my time to maintain this client so stay tuned for any imporvements!

Also, feel free to make suggestions & report bugs.
